Display UK train departures using ESP32 + ePaper Display

Here's how to build a train departure board using an ESP32, an e-Paper display panel and a bit of code. In this particular example I've used it to display a list of departures from a specific UK train station. You could easily modify it to display departure data from another rail hub or even an airport. If you're using the display on a model railway or diorama you could of course just generate your own data without using a 3rd party data provider.

Check out my channel for other tutorials on how to use the ESP32 and other microcontrollers to display data on ePaper and OLED displays.
